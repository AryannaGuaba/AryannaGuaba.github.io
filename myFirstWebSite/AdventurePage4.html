		<h3>What happened after I chose option A for day 3</h3>
		
		<p>Option A: The sub woke me up after a few minutes of class. I had to run out of the room and since ela was my last period I was already late to the bus. I had to call my mom so that she could get me...before leaving I glanced at my locker...there was nothing there...I'm a little mad Ryuku didn't wake me up as soon as class ended but we aren't friends much...
		<br> +0 affection!</p>
		<h3>What happened after I chose option B for day 3</h3>
		<img src="DoodleLocker.jpg" width="400" height="550">
		<p>Option B: I ended up falling asleep after doodling so much. I was bored after all. I woke up to Ryuku who was tugging on my sweater. He heard bus kids were being dismissed and all I could do was thank him. He even walked me out of class and when we passed my locker...he put a bunch of sticky pads with doodles on it! I smiled so hard when he tapped it to the locker so it wouldn't fall off...He's so nice!
		<br> +1 affection! </p>
		<h4>By the Lockers</h4>
		<p>The next day we sat by the lockers just talking about random things. I enjoy writing now, especially about us. I hope we can be such good friends. Things were pretty quiet with us so I looked into his eyes after a while and blurted out</p>
		<br>
		<p style="color:ghostwhite">
		Choice A: You look like you could be Pinkie Pie's brother!
		<br>
		<br>
		Choice B: You look like a carrot...?
