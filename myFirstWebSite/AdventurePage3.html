		<h1>Classroom Madness.</h1>
		
		<h2>Day 3</h2>
		<p>Really?!? I try to interact with him and gym class ends IMMEDIATELY?!??! WHY?!?</p>

		<br>

		<h3>What happened after I chose option A or B for day 2</h3>
		
		<p>Option A: So I missed. Turns out luck did not have my side...I was going for 2 points originally but he dashed to me once I stole that ball and blocked me never letting me go. I shot for a 3-pointer. When that ball fell down on the floor all I did was look at him as he just held in his laughter knowing I couldn't do a single thing. He did put a hand on my shoulder after class ended and whispered in my ear that it was a good try..but that I'd never beat him. I would've beat him if there was more time...
		<br> +1 affection!</p>

		<p>Option B: Well we just talked about our day and all that. I figured out that he likes the color pink and that he's a big fan of goth fashion. It was no shocker though he acts all tough and dark with his hair in his face. Though he was a bit distracted from our talk and didn't hear the gym teacher yelling at him to put the ball away..he ended up getting yelled at...
		<br> +0.5 affection! </p>

		<h4>Ela Class</h4>
		<p>So many kids are talking about cool things they wrote in their journals for this project. So many people are shooting just playing games and having fun. This room is in chaos but the ela teacher isn't here. She left early and we had some sub in our room. Then there's just me writing about trying to talk to some stupid guy. Ryuku was just sleeping next to me and not even talking to me. So I literally have nothing to do...I did see he had his notebook out mixed with sticky pads that had tons of doodles that he made with his expensive paint markers...All his doodles are interesting especially with all the splatters of paint on it to make it more messy. Being bored I decided to... </p>
		<br>
		<p style="color:ghostwhite">
		Choice A: Doze off since Ryu was also asleep.
		<br>
		<br>
		Choice B: Take a sticky pad of his and doodle something.
