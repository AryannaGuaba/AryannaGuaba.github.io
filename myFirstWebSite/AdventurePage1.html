		<h1>The Journal Project.</h1>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		
		<p> Transfering in the middle of the year from your old school to this new one was so far a horrible experience. You lost all your friends and even your lover. <br> Being miles away your forced to attend Clownieversity where the students are a mix of silly and serious. A lively school full of diverse and positive students!It's up to you to choose if u wanna make your situation better or not...

		<h3>Day 1</h3>

		<p>Im writing this before ela class. So far the first few weeks have paased and I haven't been able to make friends. Getting ready for the day I do the daily essentials and pick up a cup of coffee and start the day. <br> Sitting in the back of my parents car I realized today is the first project I had since I transfered. Eventually my thoughts ended as i saw the school in the distance. <br> In the next few minutes I was just standing outside the car just watching my parents drive away. </p>

I think his name was Ryuku and does this teacher really think Im that lonely?! <br>This teacher wanted to do some fun project since the past few weeks it's been nonstop essays. The whole goal of this journal project is to document our daily lives. Most students had friends and had stuff to talk about..so I don't understand why I couldn't just talk about my daily life minus the friends part. The whole project was supposed to be some "cleanse" from all the hard work. <br> Whatever that means...basically my partner is this huge goth looking guy with a good amount of muscle. I was supposed to find him after class to talk about some things I could write in my journal that would be interesting like after school shopping together but he didn't even want to meet me. I only found him after school in the gym through other students who told me he was the star athelete. So I barged in the room and...</p>
