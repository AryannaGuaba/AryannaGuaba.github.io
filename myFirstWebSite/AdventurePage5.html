		<h1>Could this be the beginning of something new..?</h1>
		
		<h2>Day 5</h2>
		<br>

		<h3>What happened after I chose option A or B for day 4</h3>
		
		<p>Option A: He smirked and said it was nice that I thought of him like that. I guess he likes my little pony...
		<br> +0.5 affection!</p>

		<p>Option B: He kind of just stared at me confused...after a few minutes he told me thank you. When I asked him why he was saying thank you over that stupid comment he just looked down at me and told me that his favorite things were carrots. So he took it with pride...he reminds me of a bunny especially when he told me he could down 5 carrot cakes in a row. What is wrong with him.
		<br> +1 affection! </p>
		<h4>Ryuku has something to tell me..?</h4>
		<p>After class today he came up to me and said...</p>	
		<br>
		<p style="color:ghostwhite">
		If you had an affection score of 3 or below: "Look once you're done with the Journal. I don't think I'd really wanna talk to you more...I mean your cool and all that just...not really for me man. Good luck on whatever you got going on dork."
		<br>
		<br>
		If you had an affection score of 4 or the max(5): "Hey uh...do you wanna go somewhere with me after all this? I think the coffee shop will be nice. What do you think y/n...? My new weirdo friend.
