		<h1>Hallway Meetings.</h1>
		
		<h2>Day 2</h2>
		<p> So..I got kicked out the gym and never met with the guy. Shockingly he came to me in the hallway today...</p>

		<br>

		<h3>What happened after I chose option A or B for day 1</h3>
		
		<p>Option A:I didn't think he would come to school so early. Ryuku has got this stare that scares the living out of me. He looks like he wants me dead. I'm still shocked he's one of our schools star atheletes. I think he wants to really kill me. When I looked him in the eyes and called him emo again all he could do was break his straight face. He liked that I insulted him. Which is so weird but when I asked him about it all he told me was that "The new student who I'm forced to pair with because you can't make a friend nor are interesting enough to make one starts yelling at me?! Calling me a stupid emo?? It was very funny especially watching you get kicked out. I laughed lots." Ryu has such a high ego it's bad. Regardless I think he's warming up to me...
		<br> +1 affection!</p>

		<p>Option B:I was a bit nervous when he came up to me. He's staring daggers at me and I don't like it...However he just..stood there rolling his eyes just waiting for me to talk to him about some things we could do to spice up our journal projects. Well really mine..because he has friends and I don't and uh..you get it. I don't think he really likes me..
		<br> -1 affection! </p>

		<h4>The whole school day</h4>
		<p>So it's looking like when we see each other in the halls he nods in my direction. It's nice that someone acknowledges me! There was not much of my day that was interesting though...However I did find Ryuku in another class. He's in my gym class and I can see why he's our schools top athlete. The guy is good at everything he does. He was just shooting hoops and well I tried to join in. I'm determined to make us interact more...and hopefully even be friends.</p>
		<br>
		<p style="color:ghostwhite">
		Choice A: I run to snatch the ball away from Ryuku and try to score some points for myself.
		<br>
		<br>
		Choice B: I begin trying to make some small talk with him.
