		<h1>The Final by Aryanna Guaba</h1>

		<h2>Aramela</h2>
		
		<p> Aramela, a scared princess ventures through the spooky forest in order to get home.<br> However she quickly becomes paranoid as if someone or something is watching her. <br> This project was supposed to be a fun little final project instead of anything serious.<br> I'm not a political person and would've prefered to do something lively. <br> The feeling i'm trying to convey is a sense of fear or something serious.
